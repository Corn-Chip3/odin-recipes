        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Cake Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 3/4 cups (219g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)</li>

            <li>1 and 3/4 cups (350g) granulated sugar</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons espresso powder (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil (or canola oil or melted coconut oil)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) freshly brewed strong hot coffee (regular or decaf)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chocolate Buttercream Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 1/4 cups (2.5 sticks or 290g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>3 and 1/2 cups (420g) confectioners sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or dutch process)</li>
            <li>3-5 Tablespoons (45-75ml) heavy cream (or half-and-half or milk), at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>optional for decoration: semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.</li>
            <li>Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed until the batter is completely combined. Batter is thin.</li>
            <li>Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely in the pan.</li>
            <li>With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy - about 2 minutes. Add confectioners sugar, cocoa powder, 3 Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners sugar or cocoa powder if frosting is too thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is too thick. (I usually add 1 more.) Taste. Add another pinch of salt if desired.</li>
            <li>If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula and bench scraper for the frosting. Garnish with chocolate chips, if desired.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate uncovered cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing to help set the shape. After that, you can serve the cake or continue refrigerating for up to 4-6 hours before serving. Cake can be served at room temperature or chilled.</li>
            <li>Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days. I like using a cake carrier for storing and transporting.</li>
